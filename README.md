> We have no other notion of cause and effect, but that of certain objects, which have always conjoinâ€™d together, and which in all past instances have been found inseparable. We cannot penetrate into the reason of the conjunction. We only observe the thing itself, and always find that from the constant conjunction the objects acquire an union in the imagination.
